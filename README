                                   CSS Parser

                          A CSS parser written in PHP


                                      ===


Why on earth would anyone need that?

For example: Stylesheet validation, minimizing and compressing, stripping
comments, adding and modifying reliably, ...


Technology?

I'm relying on the PHP ParserGenerator and PHP LexerGenerator libraries from
PEAR. They are also used successfully by the famous Smarty template engine.


Status?

An early alpha. At the moment only the lexer works satisfactorily. But that
shouldn't discourage you from jumping aboard and helping out.


License?

The code in the build directory is distributed under the GPL v2 or later and
an MIT-like license.
